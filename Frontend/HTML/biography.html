        <p> Welcome to Rohit's Cougar Cafe at the University of Houston - Sugarland. I am Rohit Muthukumar, the proud owner and culinary einthusiast behind this energetic Cafe.

        <p>Crafting Culinary Experiences:

        Since childhood, I've been captivated by the magic of food : its ability to connect, comfort, and inspire. After years of honing my skills in the kitchen and exploring diverse culinary landscapes, I decided to express my love for cooking into something more profound â€“ a space where people could gather, share stories, and savor delicious meals crafted with care.
